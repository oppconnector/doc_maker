    <p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</p>
    <p>The U.S. government is seeking robust and reliable contractor support to provide __product or service___ in support of the _end user    in _name of location_. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>KVG LLC is a Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business headquartered in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, with offices and works throughout the world—including team offices in Moldova, Poland, the Philippines, Romania, Sierra Leone, the United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, Estonia and the Republic of Georgia.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The KVG Team has served the United States Department of Defense and other federal departments and agencies as a Prime Contractor since 2013, delivering military exercise support and other dedicated services across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>KVG’s offer provides a compliant cost-effective solution that has proven successful for several Base Life Support projects. Past relevant works include:  </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Field feeding and field sanitation for 1,500 U.S. Military and Partner Nation personnel in the Republic of Georgia during exercise Agile Spirit 2019 on contracts W564KV-19-Q-0042 and W564KV-19-Q-0043.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Several base life support operations for 1000 soldiers in Poland during multi-national exercise Anakonda 2016 on contract W564KV-16-P-0029.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>and government personnel conducting operations in Cyprus by describing our implementation plan, our customer-centric technical approach, and our

    <p>Operations</p>
    <p>Write the Operations Plan here. It is a summary of the works to be performed to complete the tasks outlined in the SoW/PWS.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>QUALITY CONTROL</p>
    <p>KVG maintains the certification for and utilizes International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001: 2015 to ensure consistent and effective processes to develop, document, implement, maintain, and continuously improve our comprehensive higher-level QMS. This assures compliance with the most current version of American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/ISO/American Society for Quality (ASQ) 9001 (currently 9001:2015) in execution of the ID/IQ and each Task Order contract with a specific focus on the Services Summary and Deliverables.  We utilize our in-house QMS to ensure only goods and/or services that meet specifications are delivered to the USG and end users. This allows for consistent and accurate documentation and clarity throughout the entire process of the contract and subsequent task orders. KVG will monitor costs, schedules, and performance data including inspection records for each Task Order which will subsequently be made available to the Government to ensure coherency with reporting and billing matters between all necessary stakeholders. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>KVG ensures the KO, or authorized representative access to all work areas, records, and data used in the performance of contracted services.  Our team will provide support the KO, and other designated personnel in the performance of their official duties. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>KVG will notify the USG in writing of any issue that impacts our abilities to meet established milestones or timelines or any cost or performance concerns. In the unlikely event of a failure to fulfill a part of the contract or specific Task Order, KVG will provide a minimum of a corrective plan of action that would include but not limited to: </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Action taken to fix the immediate problem (correction) </p>
    <p>Root cause analysis of the problem to determine cause </p>
    <p>Corrective action on the cause of the problem (how performance will be returned to acceptable levels (how to get back on schedule / within cost / appropriate quality level of performance)</p>
    <p>Actions taken to prevent recurrence to include a follow-up plan (how and when)</p>
    <p>All supporting evidence for actions taken, such as updated manuals, instructions, procedures, etc.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Strict adherence to our own practices and standards is critical to our success. Following our Work Plan and QCP procedures reinforces our commitment to customer service and provides the backbone of our training and communications plans.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Our Global Division team will supervise this task order’s quality control. Concurrently, our Quality Control Manager, Mr. Shuhrat Murodilloev, PMP, will manage total quality control for this project, directing and guiding our contract managers to ensure the KVG Team is on-time, on-track, and compliant with everything we do.</p>
    <p></p>
